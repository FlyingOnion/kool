# name is the name of controller
# will be set to "Controller" if not set
name: KoolPodController

# retryOnError is the times of retry on error
# the range is 0 to 10, default is 3
# if set to 0, it will not retry
retryOnError: 3

# namespace sets the namespace of all resources
# if namespace is empty, controller will control resources in all namespaces
namespace: ""

# resources is the list of resources that controller may control
# resources[0] is the main resource
# it's the resource that your controller wants to control
# if resource is empty it will not control any resource
# if you want to use builtin resource like Pod, Service, Deployment, etc., leave the group field empty

# customHandlers adds event handlers for the resource
# it's a list of strings, containing "Create", "Update" and "Delete"
# by default, the main resource (resources[0]) SHOULD customize all 3 handlers
# and the generated code has already implemented them
# for other resources, you don't need to add all of them, just add the ones you need
# if customHandlers is empty, kool-gen will generate all 3 custom handlers to custom.go

# package is the go package name of the resource
# if package is empty, it means that the resource is defined in the "main" package
# if group is empty, the value of package field will be ignored
# kool-gen will set this field as "k8s.io/api/<group>/<version>", where group and version depends on kind
# for example, if kind is "Deployment", the package will be "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"

# # example1: only control builtin resources like official DeploymentController
# resources:
# - kind: Deployment
# - kind: ReplicaSet
# - kind: Pod
#   customHandlers:
#   - Delete

# example2: control custom resources
resources:
- group: whatevergroup.com
  version: v1
  kind: Foo
  package: ""
- group: whatevergroup.com
  version: v1
  kind: Bar
  package: ""
  customHandlers:
  - Update
  - Delete

# # example3: control external resources from third-party projects
# resources:
# - group: database.spotahome.com
#   version: v1
#   kind: RedisFailover
#   package: github.com/spotahome/redis-operator/api/redisfailover/v1

# resources: []
